# Natural Language Processing for Chatbots

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent chatbot capable of understanding and responding to customer queries in natural language. The chatbot leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, deep learning models, and sequence-to-sequence architectures to achieve human-like interactions. This project demonstrates skills in NLP, deep learning, sequence-to-sequence models, dialogue systems, and transfer learning with state-of-the-art models like GPT-3.

## Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect and preprocess data related to customer queries and responses. Ensure the data is clean, consistent, and ready for model training.

- **Data Sources:** Customer service logs, chatbot interaction logs, FAQ datasets.
- **Techniques Used:** Data cleaning, tokenization, normalization, handling missing values, feature extraction.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform EDA to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and gain insights into the types of queries and responses.

- **Techniques Used:** Data visualization, summary statistics, word frequency analysis, topic modeling.

### 3. Feature Engineering
Create features that capture the semantic and syntactic information from the text data.

- **Techniques Used:** TF-IDF, word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), sentence embeddings (BERT, GPT).

### 4. Model Building
Develop and evaluate different models for the chatbot, including sequence-to-sequence models and transformer-based architectures.

- **Techniques Used:** RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, Attention Mechanism, Transformer models.

### 5. Transfer Learning with GPT-3
Leverage GPT-3 for advanced natural language understanding and generation to enhance the chatbot's performance.

- **Techniques Used:** Fine-tuning GPT-3, prompt engineering, API integration.

### 6. Dialogue Management
Implement dialogue management strategies to handle multi-turn conversations and maintain context.

- **Techniques Used:** Dialogue state tracking, context management, response generation.

### 7. Model Deployment
Deploy the trained chatbot model to a production environment for real-time interaction with users.

- **Techniques Used:** Model saving/loading, API development, deployment strategies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nlp_chatbot.git
   cd nlp_chatbot
   
2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
### Data Preparation

1. Place raw data files in the data/raw/ directory.
2. Run the data preprocessing script to prepare the data:
    ```bash
    python src/data_preprocessing.py
    
### Running the Notebooks

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    
2. Open and run the notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to preprocess data, perform EDA, engineer features, develop models, fine-tune GPT-3, manage dialogues, and deploy the model:
 - data_preprocessing.ipynb
 - exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb
 - feature_engineering.ipynb
 - model_building.ipynb
 - transfer_learning_gpt3.ipynb
 - dialogue_management.ipynb
 - model_deployment.ipynb
   
### Training Models

1. Train the sequence-to-sequence model:
    ```bash
    python src/model_building.py --model seq2seq
    
2. Train the transformer model:
    ```bash
    python src/model_building.py --model transformer
    
### Results and Evaluation

 - Model Performance: Evaluate the models using metrics such as BLEU score, ROUGE score, and perplexity. Analyze the model outputs to ensure meaningful and contextually accurate responses.
 - Dialogue Management: Test the chatbot's ability to handle multi-turn conversations and maintain context. Evaluate the chatbot's performance in real-world scenarios.
 - Transfer Learning with GPT-3: Leverage GPT-3 to enhance the chatbot's language understanding and generation capabilities. Fine-tune GPT-3 for specific use cases and evaluate its performance.
   
### Model Deployment

Deploy the trained chatbot model to a production environment for real-time interaction with users. Ensure the model is integrated with a user-friendly interface and can handle concurrent requests.
